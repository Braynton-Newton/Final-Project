    <h3>Central A & M Growing Together</h3>
    <p>Hello. We would like to introduce ourselves. I am MeLinda Hilligoss the Central A & M 3-5 years old and their families Family Consultant and Sara Marley is the Central A & M 0-3 years old BabyTalk Family Consultant. The Central A & M 0-3 and 3-5 years old programs are called Growing Together. The Growing Together 0-3 program is funded and implemented through BabyTalk while the Growing Together 3-5 program is funded through an Illinois State Board of Education Early Childhood grant. Growing Together strives to support parents by providing opportunities for parent and child to strengthen their relationship. There are many different activities available for parents and children 0-5. Growing Together Playgroups allow children to work on social skills, developmental skills, and enrichment through interacting with other children and adults. And it is just a lot of fun! Not only can children have the opportunity to interact with peers but parents can also network with other parents during Playgroup. We also conduct home visits with families. Home visits are another way to strengthen the bond between parent and child and to receive one-on-one opportunities with the Family Consultant to address any concerns the parent may have. During a home visit, a Family Consultant will work with the parent and child on enhancing the child’s developmental skills and provide age appropriate activities for the parent and child to work on together. Family Consultants can also find resources to meet a family’s needs, if requested by the family. Do you need a family night out? Family Fun Nights are fun for everyone! Various activities and/or presentations are planned for the Central A & M communities during Family Fun Nights.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Family Consultants can also screen children to determine where they are in their development and provide activities to enhance the skills that need strengthened.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>All activities are Free.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Our office is located in the Middle School in the Prekindergarten room. The address is 404 Colegrove Suite B Assumption, IL 62510     217-226-4022  ext:221</p>
